<h1>Sharmishtha Balwan</h1>
<p>Hello, nice to meet you! I'm Sharmishtha, an associate product manager and a user experience designer.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I currently work at <a href="http://www.agrostar.in">AgroStar</a> and we are building a platform helping farmers get the best crop care. Farmers can also buy best agri-inputs here. Find more about it <a href="http://agrostar.in/agrostarfarmerapp/">here</a>. I've been working here since October 2015 and used to work as a financal analyst for a short time earlier. You can look at my profile on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmishthabalwan/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>


<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I graduated from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in 2015 with a Bachelors in Electronics & Instrumentation and a Minor in Film & Media. I was a part of the Dept. of Art, Design & Publicity at Pilani, which contributed to organising the cultural festivals in the campus, called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oasis.bitspilani/">Oasis</a>. The club also made life-size artworks & structures to decorate the festival to the theme.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I love to travel, swim and read. I like non-fiction since quite some time now and am currently learning about Psychology and HCI. I also paint occassionally and am learning water colours again as I've lost touch. I collect lines & shots from movies or literature that create a lasting impact on me. Find some of it <a href="https://in.pinterest.com/sharmishtha27/last/">here</a>, if you'd like. I'm a yatri from the <a href="http://www.jagritiyatra.com/experience">JY 2016</a>. It gave me a very real, humbling experience of our country and how entrepreneurs and groups of people are contributing to change.</p>
